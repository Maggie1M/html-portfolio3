<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>For quite some time I have been thinking about doing the Web Development course.<br/> For years I hadn't thought I was cut out for it, but something inside was telling me to give it a go.<br/> At the end of the day, what could happen other than me finding my dream job, that will provide the flexibility<br/> and learning curb I have been looking for. I am already happy I have managed to come this far.<br/> These are my first HTML projects. I know this course will only get more complex, but I am so ready!<br/> Bring it on Angela!</p>
